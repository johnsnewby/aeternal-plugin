## Packaging
Run `npm run dist` to create a zipped, production-ready extension for each browser. You can then upload that to the appstore.

##### Load the extension in Chrome & Opera
1. Open Chrome/Opera browser and navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Select "Developer Mode" and then click "Load unpacked extension..."
3. From the file browser, choose to `extension-boilerplate/build/chrome` or (`extension-boilerplate/build/opera`)

## Developing
The following tasks can be used when you want to start developing the extension and want to enable live reload - 

- `npm run chrome-watch`
- `npm run opera-watch`
- `npm run firefox-watch`
