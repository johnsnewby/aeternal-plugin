  <h1>
    Extension Boilerplate  
  </h1>

  <p>
    <strong>A foundation for creating browser extensions for Chrome, Opera & Firefox.</strong>
  </p>
</div>

Now that Firefox supports WebExtensions, it has become a lot easier to build browser extensions/addons for multiple browsers without duplicating the codebase. This project serves as a sensible starting point to help you get started.

I have extracted this from the browser extensions that I built for my side-project, [Email This](https://www.emailthis.me).

> Side note: Do check out [**Email This**](https://www.emailthis.me). It is a simpler alternative to bookmarking tools like Pocket, Readability & Instapaper. Email This will remove distractions & ads from an article and send you a nice email with just the text/images. You can then open up the email client on your laptop/mobile and read the article whenever you want. No need to install any additional applications or login to another app just to access your bookmarks.


## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Write once and deploy to Chrome, Opera & Firefox</dt>
  <dd>
    Based on WebExtensions. It also includes a tiny polyfill to bring uniformity to the APIs exposed by different browsers.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Live-reload</dt>
  <dd>
    Your changes to CSS, HTML & JS files will be relayed instantly without having to manually reload the extension. This ends up saving a lot of time and improving the developer experience.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Sensible starting point</dt>
  <dd>
    This comes with a gulp based workflow that converts modern **ES6** JavaScript and **SCSS** to JS/CSS. 
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Sketch (.sketch) assets for icons and promo images</dt>
  <dd>
    A .sketch file is included in the resources directory. This has all the icons and promo images that will be needed while uploading the extensions to the app stores.
  </dd>
</dl>

3. From the file browser, choose to `ext-starter/build/chrome` or (`ext-starter/build/opera`)

2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and from the file browser, choose `ext-starter/build/firefox`


## Developing
The following tasks can be used when you want to start developing the extension and want to enable live reload - 
`npm rum chrome-watch`

`npm run firefox-watch`


## Packaging
Run `npm run dist` to create a zipped, production-ready extension for each browser. You can then upload that to the appstore.
